# $$Go Wars$$

## On a terminal in a dark room far far away...

> One developer with his laptop, fruit snacks, coke, and love of the galaxy embarked on an adventure. Calling on his exploits with his trusty TI-83 decades ago, he recreated the past in the future.
The adventure begins with only your wit and your trusty light saber and "... the search for more money."
